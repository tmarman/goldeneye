# M002: Deep Apple Ecosystem Integration

**Status**: Exploring
**Priority**: P1 - Strategic
**Depends On**: M001 Foundation

## Objective

Create tight integration with Apple's native capabilities to differentiate from cross-platform agent solutions.

## Areas to Explore

### AppIntents Integration
- Expose agent capabilities as App Intents
- Enable Shortcuts integration for agent workflows
- Siri voice triggers for agent tasks

### System Integration
- Spotlight indexing of agent artifacts
- Focus modes affecting agent behavior
- Notification summarization via agents

### Privacy & Security
- On-device processing for sensitive tasks
- PCC for heavy computation with privacy
- Keychain integration for credentials
- App Sandbox compliance

### Cross-Device
- Handoff between devices mid-task
- Universal Clipboard for agent outputs
- iCloud Drive as shared agent workspace

## Open Questions

- How much can we do without private APIs?
- What's the App Store review story for agent apps?
- PCC access — public API timeline?

## Research Needed

- [ ] Survey current AppIntents capabilities
- [ ] Investigate SwiftUI + agent UI patterns
- [ ] PCC documentation and access requirements
